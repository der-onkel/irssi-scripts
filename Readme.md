Irssi scripts
=============

fastswitch.pl
--------------

Irssi script for easy window switching.
Fastswitch provides the possibility to switch between your windows
and queries just by type /&lt;WINDOW_NUMBER&gt; or /&lt;CHANNEL_NAME|QUERY_NAME&gt;

If CHANNEL_NAME miss the prefix character the script will try to find a
channel with one of this prefixes "#, +, & or !".
To switch off this behavior set "fastswitch_guess_prefix" to 0
