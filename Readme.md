--------------

Irssi script for easy window switching.   
fastswitch provides the possibility to switch between your windows  
and query just by type /&lt;WINDOW_NUMBER&gt; or /&lt;CHANNEL_NAME|QUERYNAME&gt;  

If channel_name miss the prefix character the script will try to find a  
channel with one of this prefixes "#, +, & or !".  
To switch of this behavior set "fastswitch_guess_prefix" to 0
